# dto-hackday-ideas

The [Digital Transformation Office](https://www.dto.gov.au/) is seeking to host a Hack Day to promote a fast-paced, productive, and team-building atmosphere as part of everyday work.

Appetite for a DTO Hack Day has stemmed from suggestions raised by members of the Hearts and Minds Guild and the Tech Guild. We are mindful of the current strain on resources, particular in the developer space, on in-flight projects. We believe with ample planning that we can continue to deliver against DTO projects while bringing value to the DTO community through extra cirricular events.

## How it will work
1. We will be asking DTO staff to submit ideas for Hack projects via issues in this repository.
2. We will review all ideas and curate them into *2 key projects* for the Hack Day.
3. We will announce the date for the event.
4. We will post the 2 key projects, and invite DTO staff to join a project that interests them.
* We will provide plenty of education of what we think a good team will look like.
5. We will provide the work spaces, tools, a recommended schedule, and whatever else everyone needs to build their thing over the course of 8 hours.
6. At the end of the event, we will invite teams to present what they built, why and how, and celebrate everyone's achievements!
